# packdemo
my demo of using grunt, gulp, webpack, and rollup to pack the project.
In this project, you'll know how to configrate and pack a project via these tools.
Please have fun if you feel it's useful for you.

## start it
- `npm install` to load all the plugins uesd by this project.
- `node app.js` , if you install the supervisor plugin, you can also use this command:  `supervisor app.js`
- Then, input `localhost:3000/` or `localhost:3000/index` in your brower to see it how to work.
